** Analysis of Franson interference using ring-generated photons

A correlated photon pair that is generated from a ring resonator via
spontaneous four-wave mixing can serve as the input to another ring
resonator serving as a Franson interferometer. This work presents a
spectral theory for the generated signal and idler pair, including 
properties that may be impressed on the pair by the pump
photons. Coincidence parameters and phase properties of the output states
from the generating ring characterize the input state to another ring
resonator that acts as a Franson interferometer.  Behaviors of the
interference signatures are explored in terms of design parameters of
silicon photonics devices such as ring-channel coupling, and with respect
to experimental parameters such as pump spectral distributions.
