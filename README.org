Concept calculations for quantum optics


** Introduction
Computations for physical concepts are coded in Python modules with names
of the form CCqo<ddd>_<concept>.py where <ddd> is a number that is unique
in the CCqo catalog of modules and <concept> is the particular concept
being calculated.

** Models
*** CCqo103_spectral_pump

** Development Notes
*** TODO CCqo103_spectral_pump finalization [0/5]
  - [ ] Document module
  - [ ] Document valArrayTests()
  - [ ] Document getInputs()
  - [ ] Add doctests for validateParameters()
  - [ ] Gather and run verification data
